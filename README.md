## Election-Aduit Summary 

Expanding the dataset to include voter turnout by county with candidates is a great way to take advantage of the scrip. The added insight can be a guide for future election performance, so that you may properly allocate resources where turnout is low or demographics are hard to reach. A little time invested into customizing the script can provide on-demand analysis for years to come. For example, we could also dive deeper and determine what percentage of each county voted for each candidate by adding an if-statement to the code. That is a just a small example of the many filters and data i can provide.
